// Scrum is a framework that teams can use to build a sustainable product - development process.The framework defines

// 1) The product owner as the person that directs the highest priority development of the product

// 2) The Scrum master that helps the team follow its process and be most efficient

// 3) The development team that completes the work that the product owner specifies

// 4) The sprint, some amount of time during which the Scrum process is run

// 5) Sprint planning which provides the road map for what to accomplish during a sprint

// 6) The daily scrum, a meeting that the Scrum team attends to communicate its activities and blockers

// 7) The show and tell which allows a larger group visibility into the products of the sprint

// 8) The retrospective, which allows the team to determine process improvements

// 9) Backlog grooming performed by the product owner to ensure that the backlog of stories is well ordered and defined

// That's the framework of Scrum, the most popular Agile software development methodology in use today.

// That they are timeboxed; 
// That they have a short and consistent duration
// That they have an unalterable goal; and,
// That they can only conclude using the teamâ€™s definition of done.
